//! Whether this build can actually reach a GPU.
//!
//! Two separate questions, and callers care about both:
//!
//! - Was the extension compiled with the `gpu` feature? Fixed at wheel-build
//!   time; a Python extra cannot change it, because extras only add Python
//!   requirements and never swap the compiled artefact.
//! - Is there an adapter on this machine? Only answerable at runtime, and the
//!   answer is legitimately "no" on a headless box or in a container without
//!   the Vulkan loader.
//!
//! [`gpu_available`] answers both at once, since a caller choosing between
//! `EVoC` and `EVoCGpu` has no use for the distinction.

/// ### Returns
///
/// `True` only when this build has the `gpu` feature **and** wgpu resolves an
/// adapter. Safe to call on any machine.
///
/// ### Note
///
/// Acquiring a client panics rather than erroring when no adapter is found, so
/// the probe catches it. That is sound here because the release profile is
/// pinned to `panic = "unwind"`, which pyo3 requires anyway. The panic hook is
/// silenced for the duration, otherwise merely asking the question prints a
/// backtrace to stderr.
